# Discord Export for Wordle

Discord export for Wordle (DEW) is a web extension that adds a secondary `Discord` share button to the NYTimes Wordle site. When the player has completed the game and clicks `Share`, Wordle normally fills the clipboard with emoji representing the guesses for the game. Clicking the new `Discord` button works similarly, but instead of the clipboard containing just the emoji for the game, it will also have the text of each guess appended to each line of emoji - hidden in a spoiler.

Take this Wordle game for example:

<img src="img/game.PNG" alt="game" width="200"/>

Upon winning the game, the user will be shown their stats and a share button:

<img src="img/stats.PNG" alt="stats" width="200"/>

Clicking the `Share` button will copy this text to their clipboard to paste onto social media sites:

```
Wordle 269 4/6

ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬›
â¬›ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬›ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Clicking the `Discord` button instead will edit this output so that it becomes:

```
Wordle 269 4/6

ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬› ||`STEAM`||
â¬›ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ ||`DATES`||
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬›ğŸŸ¨ ||`TEALS`||
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

This output, when pasted into Discord, will render as the following:

<img src="img/discord-1.PNG" alt="discord" width="200"/>

This allows you to share your guessing journey with your friends, but keeping things spoiler-free- let's just hope they don't take a peek at those words until they've finished their game. ;)
